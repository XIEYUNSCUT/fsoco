# MM-Labels to darknet

A quick 'n dirty tool to convert the label format of munichs labeling tool (https://github.com/ddavid/MM-label-tool) to Darknet YOLO format. Should work ...

# How to use?

No command line parameters. Just change the variables **idir**, **odir**, **width** and **height** and run the python file.
By default, **blue cones** will be mapped to class index **0**, **yellow** to class **1**, **orange** to **2** and **big-orange** to **3**, though of course you can also change that.
