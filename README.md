## Contributing
We have set a minimum contribution amount of <strong>600</strong> images.<br/>
Small enough not to be a large burden and large enough for the data set to grow naturally.

##### "We don't have any Data or Cones."
Sharing is caring. This data set lives from your contribution.
If you don't have access to FS Cones we can provide you with raw data.
This way, newer teams get an easy way to buy-in.

If you're interested in accessing this dataset: 
1. [Write us an e-mail](mailto:fsoco@munichmotorsport.de)
1. Upload data to shared Google Photos album
    1. On `Settings` choose `High quality (free unlimited storage)`
1. Fork the repository
1. Add labels to the repository
    1. If your labels use indices for the classes: Add `shortTeamName-classes.txt` to your label directory. See examples at `labels/mms` `labels/elbflorace`
1. Update [documentation](https://ddavid.github.io/fsoco/)
1. [Add relevant scripts to the repository] OPTIONAL but highly encouraged
1. Open pull request

The pictures are saved and shared through a Google Photos account created because of the available free unlimited storage without significant loss of quality.
